# The Garden of Earthly Delights
This project is a personal project I've been working on throughout the summer of 2023.

I chose to make a roguelite game because this year, this genre has been a discovery for me and I've enjoyed it a lot, playing games like Hades, Cult of the Lumb, Bio-Prototype, Loop Hero, Enter the Gungeon, Dead Cells, Neon Abyss, and a few more!

During the development of this project, I've learned a lot. Specifically, gameplay programming, Scriptable Objects, AI programming (movement and decision-making), UI programming (using tweening libraries), design patterns, and UML.

**Be aware:** There are some bugs in the videos and gifs that have already been fixed, but I haven't been able to update the videos yet due to time constraints. Don't worry!
