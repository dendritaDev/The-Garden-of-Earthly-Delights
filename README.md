# The Garden of Earthly Delights
This project is a personal project I've been working on throughout the summer of 2023.

I chose to make a roguelite game because this year, this genre has been a discovery for me and I've enjoyed it a lot, playing games like Hades, Cult of the Lumb, Bio-Prototype, Loop Hero, Enter the Gungeon, Dead Cells, Neon Abyss, and a few more!

During the development of this project, I've learned a lot. Specifically, gameplay programming, Scriptable Objects, AI programming (movement and decision-making), UI programming (using tweening libraries), design patterns, and UML.

**Be aware:** There are some bugs in the videos and gifs that have already been fixed, but I haven't been able to update the videos yet due to time constraints. Don't worry!

# Features
## Done

   pools, popups...

## Levels
- **First level:** 
- **Second level:** You need to make it to the end of the level alive if you want to be able to unlock the third level!
- **Third level:** In this level you will fight some watercolor monster. Kill all of them if you want to unlock the last level!
- **Fourth level:** Tons of monsters are going to try to kill you. Have you been wise before? Have you chosen the best stats when you bought them on the store? I hope so if you want to make it to the end!

### Art
  - Half of the art is made by me. The other half is taken from internet and edited by me to get the watercolor style of       the game

## UML
  - [UML Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16DbW0m3QNyMtEOaptFkmP0oJ878A7_4L?usp=sharing)
